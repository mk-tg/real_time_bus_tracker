# real_time_bus_tracker
A real time bus tracker for Phoenix, AZ


Project Title: Real Time Bus Tracker - Phoenix, AZ

Description: This project utilizes an open API from the Valley Metro Transit System in Phoenix, AZ. This API allows for real-time information on bus locations, speeds, etc to be displayed on the map. It will update the location of every bus in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area every 10 seconds. Additionally, this project will ask for the users location and will plot that on the map as well. (Note: At the current time, the map must be moved to see your location plot. The map stays centered on Phoenix.)

How to Run: This project runs without input from the user regardless of whether location access is allowed. The map can be scrolled and zoomed.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:

Center the map on the user's location
Only load vehicles that are currently within the map bounds
Make the bus markers clickable and expose more information about that vehicle
